## Flare SpriteSheet Packing

### 1. Inside of bestEnclosingRect folder run

    make
When using Windows/MinGW32, it should be

    mingw32-make

This should produce rectpacker executable (under WIndows/MinGW it will have *.exe extension)

### 2. Make sure you have installed:

    Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    Pillow (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow) for Python 2.7
    NumPy (http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) for Python 2.7

### 3. Be sure there is no uncommitted work in your flare game repo, as step 4 will commit all changes without asking you.

### 4. From inside the flare directory you can run the repack shell script, which is just a wrapper around the python script

    mods=<the mod you want> game_dir=<relative path such as ../../flare-noname> ./repack.sh

Example:

    mods=noname game_dir=../../flare-noname ./repack.sh

Script searches corresponding spritesheets/animation definitions in next locations:

    ${game_dir}/mods/${mod}/images/${suffixpng}

and the txt in

    ${game_dir}/mods/${mod}/animations/${suffixtxt}

### 4. Wait until it finishes. It will take a very long time because it is doing it with different heuristics and lots of trial.
